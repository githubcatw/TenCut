# TenCut
You have probably seen Unpacked 2019, where they unveiled the Galaxy S10.

Well, you might've wanted to try it out. 

But, you couldn't go to the event and don't have $1000 to pre-order it.

If you wished to try it out on your existing phone now, **then TenCut is for you!**

If you didn't read the small text on the bottom of the repo name, this is a fork of [XOutOf10](https://github.com/idoideas/XOutOf10).

This program simulates the camera hole of the S10e and S10.

## Download

You can [download the latest APK right here](https://github.com/githubcatw/TenCut/blob/master/tencut.apk?raw=true).

Supports all Android versions, all the way back to 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).

**Android 6.0+ Users**: In your first run, please make sure you "permit drawing over apps".

**Android 8.0 (Oreo) users:** Please note that the notch will be hidden when you expand your status bar. That occurs due to API limitations set by Google.

## How to Enable

1. Download and Install the app.
2. If it's your first time and you're running Android 6.0+, tap on the "Permit Drawing Over Apps" button and allow it.
3. Click on "Start".

**To stop the simulation, click on "Stop" within the app.**
