# TenCuts
This is a simulator of the Galaxy A8s (and rumored S10) camera hole.

If you didn't read the small text on the bottom of the repo name, this is a fork of [XOutOf10](https://github.com/idoideas/XOutOf10).

## Download

You can [download the latest APK right here](https://github.com/githubcatw/TenCut/blob/master/tencut.apk?raw=true).

Supports all Android versions, all the way back to 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).

**Android 6.0+ Users**: In your first run, please make sure you "permit drawing over apps".

**Android 8.0 (Oreo) users:** Please note that the notch will be hidden when you expand your status bar. That occurs due to API limitations set by Google.

## How to Enable

1. Download and Install the app.
2. If it's your first time and you're running Android 6.0+, tap on the "Permit Drawing Over Apps" button and allow it.
3. Click on "Start".

**To stop the simulation, click on "Stop" within the app.**
