# TenCuts
(=) Just a simulator of the A8s cutout.

## Download

You can [download the latest APK right here](https://github.com/githubcatw/TenCut/blob/master/app-release.apk?raw=true)

**Now supports all Android devices, all the way back to Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0!**

**Android 6.0+ Users**: In your first run, please make sure you "permit drawing over apps".

**Android 8.0 Oreo users:** Please note that the notch will be hidden when you expand your status bar. That occurs due to Android API limitations set by Google.

## How to Enable

2. If it's your first time and you're running Android 6.0+ , click on the "Permit Drawing Over Apps" button and allow it.
3. Click on "Start".

**Notice!** To stop the simulation, click on "Stop" within the app.
